                I am a final year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Engineering from LPU in India. I recently developed an interest in building iOS apps, and I have been honing my skills in this area. I am particularly passionate about creating beautiful user interfaces that are both intuitive and functional. I believe that a well-designed app can make a significant impact on user experience and satisfaction.
                
                In addition to app development, I am also passionate about cybersecurity, particularly cryptography and cyphers(shoutout to one of my favourite movies - The Imitation Game), that's partly what inspired me to build this app. I ranked #6 All India in a Capture The Flag competition conducted by BIT Mersa, and have been exploring different aspects of this field. I believe that a strong understanding of cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important in our digital age, and I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in this area.
                
                In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, I recently played for my University in the North-Zone Inter-University Chess championship conducted by AIU. I also enjoy experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to see where my passion for technology will take me in the future.
